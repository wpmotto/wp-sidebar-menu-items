Use sidebars / widget areas within your menus. Simple and flexible way for making mega menu dropdowns!

== Description ==

This is a very lightweight plugin to simply add your defined sidebar widget areas as standard WordPress menu items. This is mostly useful for creating "mega menu" style dropdown menus. 

Current solutions for adding mega menu support come with all sorts of overhead you probably don't need. This plugin uses the default WordPress api to use widgets in your sub menus to add the content you may need in a mega menu, such as images, columns, shortcodes and other sub-menus. Style as you wish.
